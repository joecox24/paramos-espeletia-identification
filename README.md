# paramos-espeletia-identification
Individual Espeletia plants are identified from aerial UAV drone images using 5 different deep learning network architectures implemented using keras. 

Paramos.ipynb contains the code implemeting each of the 5 networks with kernel sizes of 3x3 and 5x5 in the convolution layers. The 5 network architectures used are:
- FCN32
- U-Net
- ResUNet
- Attention U-Net
- Attention ResUNet


Generated Masks contains images of masks generated by the models for a small section of the surveyed area.
